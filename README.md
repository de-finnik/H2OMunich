## Inspiration
In the midst of Munich's summer heat, the lack of a convenient way to find public hydration options inspired us to create a solution for people struggling to stay cool and hydrated.

## What it does
Our app revolutionises the way people cope with the heat by guiding users to the nearest available drinking fountains and hydration spots across Munich, ensuring easy access to water sources in scorching temperatures.

## How we built it
We developed the app using a combination of a drinking fountain dataset from the city of Munich and other data from [refill germany](https://refill-deutschland.de/) and others to access and display the closest water refill stations in Munich. We used Flutter to build the app, which allowed us to create a cross-platform application.

## Challenges we faced
Overcoming the challenges of data accuracy, integrating real-time updates and ensuring a seamless user experience were among the hurdles we overcame while building the app.

## Achievements we're proud of
Successfully creating a user-friendly app that can cope with the extreme weather situations that are unfortunately part of our lives now and will become even more pronounced in the future.

## What we learned
Through this project we gained insights into user-centred app design, building cross-platform applications with Flutter and learned that hackaTUM is really fun :)

## What's next for oasis
Expanding our database of water sources, improving the app's usability, and fostering partnerships for greater coverage in Munich's neighbourhoods.
